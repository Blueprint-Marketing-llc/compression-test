<h1><br />SPDY Protocol<br />draft-mbelshe-httpbis-spdy-00</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document describes SPDY, a protocol designed for low-latency transport of content over the World Wide Web.  SPDY introduces two layers of protocol.  The lower layer is a general purpose framing layer which can be used atop a reliable transport (likely TCP) for multiplexed, prioritized, and compressed data communication of many concurrent streams.  The upper layer of the protocol provides HTTP-like semantics for compatibility with existing HTTP application servers.

<a name="rfc.section.1"></a><h3>1.&nbsp;
Overview</h3>

<p>One of the bottlenecks of HTTP implementations is that HTTP relies on multiple connections for concurrency. This causes several problems, including additional round trips for connection setup, slow-start delays, and connection rationing by the client, where it tries to avoid opening too many connections to any single server.  HTTP pipelining helps some, but only achieves partial multiplexing.  In addition, pipelining has proven non-deployable in existing browsers due to intermediary interference.
</p>
<p>SPDY adds a framing layer for multiplexing multiple, concurrent streams across a single TCP connection (or any reliable transport stream).  The framing layer is optimized for HTTP-like request-response streams, such that applications which run over HTTP today can work over SPDY with little or no change on behalf of the web application writer.
</p>
<p>The SPDY session offers four improvements over HTTP:
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Multiplexed requests: There is no limit to the number of requests that can be issued concurrently over a single SPDY connection.
</p>
<p>Prioritized requests: Clients can request certain resources to be delivered first.  This avoids the problem of congesting the network channel with non-critical resources when a high-priority request is pending.
</p>
<p>Compressed headers:  Clients today send a significant amount of redundant data in the form of HTTP headers.  Because a single web page may require 50 or 100 subrequests, this data is significant.
</p>
<p>Server pushed streams:  Server Push enables content to be pushed from servers to clients without a request.
</p>
</blockquote><p>

</p>
<p>SPDY attempts to preserve the existing semantics of HTTP. All features such as cookies, ETags, Vary headers, Content-Encoding negotiations, etc work as they do with HTTP; SPDY only replaces the way the data is written to the network.

Document Organization</h3>

<p>The SPDY Specification is split into parts: <a class='info' href='#FramingLayer'>a framing layer<span> (</span><span class='info'>SPDY Framing Layer</span><span>)</span></a>, which multiplexes a TCP connection into independent, length-prefixed frames, and <a class='info' href='#HTTPLayer'>an HTTP layer<span> (</span><span class='info'>HTTP Layering over SPDY</span><span>)</span></a>, which specifies the mechanism for overlaying HTTP request/response pairs on top of the framing layer. While some of the framing layer concepts are isolated from the HTTP layer, building a generic framing layer has not been a goal. The framing layer is tailored to the needs of the HTTP protocol and server push. It is fully expected that other protocols such as WebSockets may end up represented on top of the base framing layer in the future.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
Session (Connections)</h3>

<p>The SPDY framing layer (or "session") runs atop a reliable transport layer such as <a class='info' href='#RFC0793'>TCP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Transmission Control Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1981.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC0793]. The client is the TCP connection initiator. SPDY connections are persistent connections.
</p>
<p>For best performance, it is expected that non-battery operated clients will leave open connections until the user navigates away from all web pages referencing the connection, or until the server closes the connection. Servers are encouraged to leave connections open for as long as possible, but can terminate idle connections if necessary.  When either endpoint closes the transport-level connection, it MUST first send a <a class='info' href='#GOAWAY'>GOAWAY<span> (</span><span class='info'>GOAWAY</span><span>)</span></a> frame so that the endpoints can reliably determine if requests finished before the close. It is expected that battery-operated clients may have more involved heuristics as to when a connection should be closed.

<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h3>2.2.&nbsp;
Framing</h3>

<p>Once the connection is established, clients and servers exchange framed messages. There are two types of frames: <a class='info' href='#ControlFrames'>control frames<span> (</span><span class='info'>Control frames</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#DataFrames'>data frames<span> (</span><span class='info'>Data frames</span><span>)</span></a>.  All frames have a common header which is 8 bytes in length.
</p>
<p>The first bit of any frame indicates whether a frame is a control frame or data frame. Control frames carry a version number, a frame type, flags, and a length. Data frames contain the stream ID, flags, and the length for the payload carried after the common header. The simple header is designed to make reading and writing of frames easy.
</p>
<p>All integer values, including length, version, and type, are in network byte order.  SPDY does not enforce alignment of types in dynamically sized frames.

Notational Conventions for Framing</h3>

<p> In SPDY, since everything is defined to be in network byte-order, the most significant bit of any field is the "leftmost" in any diagram.
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p> "+" denotes the boundary of a byte (synonomous with octet in this document)
</p>
<p> "-" denotes a bit 
</p>
<p> "|" denotes field separation, which may or may not be on a byte boundary
</p>
<p> "->" at the end of a line indicates that the structure is not yet fully described
</p>
<p> "=" denotes an unknown number of bits, typically bounded by one of the fields in the frame definition
</p>
<p> "(N)" indicates that the field is N bits long
</p>
<p> "[Foo]" advises that the field is the Foo field for that frame
</p>
<p> "X" represents a reserved bit. It MUST be zeroed
</p>
<p> A number preceeded by "0x" is a hexidecimal number
</p>
<p> A number which is not preceeded by "0x" is to be interpreted as binary
</p>
<p> The numbers above the boxes indicate the byte-offset from the start of that frame or section, as appropriate
</p>
</blockquote>
<p> As an example:
</p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
     0         1         2       3
+--|------+--|------+--------+--------+
|10|[PRI]0xEE|XXXXXX| Len(16)         |
+--|------+--|------+--------+--------+
</pre></div><p>

This describes a frame which starts with 1 as the MSB, a 0 in the second most significant bit, followed by 0b11101110 (or 0xEE) as the "PRI" field, followed by 6 reserved bits, which should all be zeroed, followed by a Len field which is 16 bits long.
In other words, first two bytes would be: 0b10111011 0b10000000, followed by the Len field.

Stream creation</h3>

<p>A stream is created by sending a control frame with the type set to <a class='info' href='#SYN_STREAM'>SYN_STREAM<span> (</span><span class='info'>SYN_STREAM</span><span>)</span></a>.  If the server is initiating the stream, the Stream-ID must be even.  If the client is initiating the stream, the Stream-ID must be odd.  0 is not a valid Stream-ID. Stream-IDs from each side of the connection must increase monotonically as new streams are created.  E.g. Stream 2 may be created after stream 3, but stream 7 must not be created after stream 9. Stream IDs do not wrap: when a client or server cannot create a new stream id without exceeding a 31 bit value, it MUST NOT create a new stream.
</p>
<p>The stream-id MUST increase with each new stream.  If an endpoint receives a SYN_STREAM with a stream id which is less than any previously received SYN_STREAM, it MUST issue a <a class='info' href='#SessionErrorHandler'>session error<span> (</span><span class='info'>Session Error Handling</span><span>)</span></a> with the status PROTOCOL_ERROR.
</p>
<p>It is a protocol error to send two SYN_STREAMs with the same stream-id.  If a recipient receives a second SYN_STREAM for the same stream, it MUST issue a <a class='info' href='#StreamErrorHandler'>stream error<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stream Error Handling</span><span>)</span></a> with the status code PROTOCOL_ERROR.
</p>
<p>Upon receipt of a SYN_STREAM, the recipient can reject the stream by sending a <a class='info' href='#StreamErrorHandler'>stream error<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stream Error Handling</span><span>)</span></a> with the error code REFUSED_STREAM. Note, however, that the creating endpoint may have already sent additional frames for that stream which cannot be immediately stopped.
</p>
<p>Once the stream is created, the creator may immediately send HEADERS or DATA frames for that stream, without needing to wait for the recipient to acknowledge.

When a RST_STREAM is sent from the stream originator, it indicates a failure to complete the stream and that no further data will be sent on the stream.  When a RST_STREAM is sent from the stream recipient, the sender, upon receipt, should stop sending any data on the stream.

Session Error Handling</h3>

<p>A session error is any error which prevents further processing of the framing layer or which corrupts the session compression state.  When a session error occurs, the endpoint encountering the error MUST first send a <a class='info' href='#GOAWAY'>GOAWAY<span> (</span><span class='info'>GOAWAY</span><span>)</span></a> frame with the stream id of most recently received stream from the remote endpoint, and the error code for why the session is terminating.  After sending the GOAWAY frame, the endpoint MUST close the TCP connection.
</p>
<p>Note that the session compression state is dependent upon both endpoints always processing all compressed data.  If an endpoint partially processes a frame containing compressed data without updating compression state properly, future control frames which use compression will be always be errored.  Implementations SHOULD always try to process compressed data so that errors which could be handled as stream errors do not become session errors.
</p>
<p>Note that because this GOAWAY is sent during a session error case, it is possible that the GOAWAY will not be reliably received by the receiving endpoint.  It is a best-effort attempt to communicate with the remote about why the session is going down.

<a name="rfc.section.2.4.2"></a><h3>2.4.2.&nbsp;
Stream Error Handling</h3>

<p>A stream error is an error related to a specific stream-id which does not affect processing of other streams at the framing layer.  Upon a stream error, the endpoint MUST send a <a class='info' href='#RST_STREAM'>RST_STREAM<span> (</span><span class='info'>RST_STREAM</span><span>)</span></a> frame which contains the stream id of the stream where the error occurred and the error status which caused the error.  After sending the RST_STREAM, the stream is closed to the sending endpoint.  After sending the RST_STREAM, if the sender receives any frames other than a RST_STREAM for that stream id, it will result in sending additional RST_STREAM frames.  An endpoint MUST NOT send a RST_STREAM in response to an RST_STREAM, as doing so would lead to RST_STREAM loops.  Sending a RST_STREAM does not cause the SPDY session to be closed.
</p>
<p>If an endpoint has multiple RST_STREAM frames to send in succession for the same stream-id and the same error code, it MAY coalesce them into a single RST_STREAM frame.  (This can happen if a stream is closed, but the remote sends multiple data frames.  There is no reason to send a RST_STREAM for each frame in succession).

SETTINGS</h3>

<p>A SETTINGS frame contains a set of id/value pairs for communicating configuration data about how the two endpoints may communicate. SETTINGS frames can be sent at any time by either endpoint, are optionally sent, and are fully asynchronous.  When the server is the sender, the sender can request that configuration data be persisted by the client across SPDY sessions and returned to the server in future communications.
</p>
<p>Persistence of SETTINGS ID/Value pairs is done on a per origin/IP pair (the "origin" is the set of scheme, host, and port from the URI.

That is, when a client connects to a server, and the server persists settings within the client, the client SHOULD return the persisted settings on future connections to the same origin AND IP address and TCP port.

<p>The message is intentionally extensible for future information which may improve client-server communications. The sender does not need to send every type of ID/value. It must only send those for which it has accurate values to convey. When multiple ID/value pairs are sent, they should be sent in order of lowest id to highest id.  A single SETTINGS frame MUST not contain multiple values for the same ID.  If the recipient of a SETTINGS frame discovers multiple values for the same ID, it MUST ignore all values except the first one.
</p>
<p>A server may send multiple SETTINGS frames containing different ID/Value pairs.  When the same ID/Value is sent twice, the most recent value overrides any previously sent values.  If the server sends IDs 1, 2, and 3 with the FLAG_SETTINGS_PERSIST_VALUE in a first SETTINGS frame, and then sends IDs 4 and 5 with the FLAG_SETTINGS_PERSIST_VALUE, when the client returns the persisted state on its next SETTINGS frame, it SHOULD send all 5 settings (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in this example) to the server.

GOAWAY</h3>

<p>The GOAWAY control frame is a mechanism to tell the remote side of the connection to stop creating streams on this session.  It can be sent from the client or the server. Once sent, the sender will not respond to any new SYN_STREAMs on this session. Recipients of a GOAWAY frame must not send additional streams on this session, although a new session can be established for new streams.  The purpose of this message is to allow an endpoint to gracefully stop accepting new streams (perhaps for a reboot or maintenance), while still finishing processing of previously established streams.
</p>
<p>There is an inherent race condition between an endpoint sending SYN_STREAMs and the remote sending a GOAWAY message.  To deal with this case, the GOAWAY contains a last-stream-id indicating the stream-id of the last stream which was created on the sending endpoint in this session.  If the receiver of the GOAWAY sent new SYN_STREAMs for sessions after this last-stream-id, they were not processed by the server and the receiver may treat the stream as though it had never been created at all (hence the receiver may want to re-create the stream later on a new session).
</p>
<p>Endpoints should always send a GOAWAY message before closing a connection so that the remote can know whether a stream has been partially processed or not.  (For example, if an HTTP client sends a POST at the same time that a server closes a connection, the client cannot know if the server started to process that POST request if the server does not send a GOAWAY frame to indicate where it stopped working).
</p>
<p>After sending a GOAWAY message, the sender must ignore all SYN_STREAM frames for new streams.

HEADERS</h3>

<p>The HEADERS frame augments a group of streams or individual stream with additional metadata. This metadata is assumed to be layered: All streams of a particular group have all of a group's headers, which are then overridden by stream headers.  For HTTP layers, this metadata is interpreted as headers. It may be optionally sent on an existing stream at any time.   Specific application of the headers in this frame is application-dependent.  The name/value header block within this frame is compressed.
</p>
<p>It is expected that this scheme will achieve similar compression to the algorithm available in previous versions of SPDY for most requests, though the first request may be larger.
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

We'll maintain two levels of state between requests
  Connection level headers
  Group      level headers

At the connection level, a single hash-map of token-index to key-pair is maintained. Data in the connection-level hashmap applies to every stream on the connection.
At the group level, a hash-map of token-index to key-pair is maintained for each defined group. Data in a group-level hashmap applies only to streams that have been assigned to that group.
The assignment of a grouping is decided by the stream initiator, and is subject to constraints as defined in SETTINGS.

These constraints are:
  TotalHeaderStorageSize :  default(16k)
  MaxHeaderGroups: default(1)
  MaxEntriesInTable: default(64)

It is expected that either party will set these to larger values immediately upon connection establishment.

The token-indexes for any hash-map are not required to be contiguous; the hash-map may be sparse.
A token-index in one table has no meaning to the other; The address space for each is separate.


Each request may also include key,value pairs which are not stored.

The set of headers for any individual stream is the union of these, with the group headers overriding the connection headers, and any individually provided stream headers overriding both the group and connection headers.

Thus, a stream which is part of group 'G' on connection 'C' will have headers as computed with the following pseudo-code:

def compute_headers(stream):
  headers = {}
  for {key, value} in connection_headers[C]:
    headers[key] = value
  for {key, value} in stream_group_headers[G]:
    headers[key] = value
  for {key, value} in headers_frame:
    headers[key] = value
  return headers

A smart implementation will be able to interpret a headers frame without reconstructing the headers, and thus be able to represent and interpret headers with less memory and CPU.



Here is the format of a headers frame and headers block:
     0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7

WINDOW_UPDATE</h3>

<p>The WINDOW_UPDATE control frame is used to implement per stream and per group flow control in SPDY. Though flow control in SPDY is per hop, that is, only between the two endpoints of a SPDY connection, a flow control group exists both to allow for proxies to indicate on one side about shared resources on the other side, and also to safely allow for asynchronous creation of a large number of sender streams. If there are one or more intermediaries between the client and the origin server, flow control signals are not explicitly forwarded by the intermediaries. (However, throttling of data transfer by any recipient may have the effect of indirectly propagating flow control information upstream back to the original sender.) Flow control only applies to the data portion of data frames. Recipients must buffer all control frames. If a recipient fails to buffer an entire control frame, it MUST issue a <a class='info' href='#StreamErrorHandler'>stream error<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stream Error Handling</span><span>)</span></a> with the status code FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR for the stream.
</p>
<p>Flow control in SPDY is implemented by a data transfer window kept by the sender both for each stream, and for each flow control group. A stream is a member of exactly one flow control group. A data transfer window is a simple uint32 which represents bytes a sender is allowed to send. A sender may send min(group data transfer window, stream data transfer window) bytes at any time. Whenever bytes have been sent, the data transfer window for the stream is decremented by the amount of bytes sent and the group data transfer window is similarly decremented by the number of bytes sent. When the window size becomes less than or equal to 0, the sender must pause transmitting data frames. The receiver may send a WINDOW_UPDATE to the sender to notify the sender that it has consumed the data and has freed up buffer space in which it may receive more data.

When a new stream is created, its stream data transfer window is assigned a default transfer window size, and its group is assigned the default group of '0'.
Upon creation of the connection, the default group (0) is assigned the default group window transfer size.

  This window size is a measure of the buffering capability of the recipient. The group window should be used to indicate a shared resource, for example, the total amount of buffers the server wishes to use for the incoming connection, or, for a proxy, the total amount of available space in an outgoing server-side connection.

</p>
<p>Stream-ID: The stream ID that this WINDOW_UPDATE control frame is for.
</p>
<p>Stream-Delta-Window-Size: The additional number of bytes that the sender can transmit in addition to existing remaining stream window size. The legal range for this field is 1 to 2^31 - 1 (0x7fffffff) bytes.
</p>
<p>Group-Delta-Window-Size: The additional number of bytes that the sender can transmit in addition to existing remaining group window size for the group assigned to the stream. The legal range for this field is 1 to 2^31 - 1 (0x7fffffff) bytes.
</p>
<p>The window size as kept by the sender must never exceed 2^31 (although it can become negative in one special case). If a sender receives a WINDOW_UPDATE that causes the its window size to exceed this limit, it must send RST_STREAM with status code FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR to terminate the stream.
</p>
<p>When a SPDY connection is first established, the default initial window size for all streams is 64KB. The default initial window size for the default group (0) is 64KB. An endpoint can use the SETTINGS control frame to adjust the initial window size for any new stream. That is, its peer can start out using the 64KB default initial window size when sending data frames before receiving the SETTINGS. Because SETTINGS is asynchronous, there may be a race condition if the recipient wants to decrease the initial window size, but its peer immediately sends 64KB on the creation of a new connection, before waiting for the SETTINGS to arrive. This is only case where the window size kept by the sender may become negative. Once the sender detects this condition, it must stop sending data frames and wait for the recipient to catch up. The recipient has two choices:
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>immediately send RST_STREAM with FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR status code. This is safe for new streams where no data has been forwarded.
</p>
<p>allow the head of line blocking (as there is only one stream for the session and the amount of data in flight is bounded by the default initial window size), and send WINDOW_UPDATE as it consumes data.
</p>
</blockquote><p>

</p>
<p>In the case of option 2, both sides must compute the window size based on the initial window size in the SETTINGS. For example, if the recipient sets the initial window size to be 16KB, and the sender sends 64KB immediately on connection establishment, the sender will discover its window size is -48KB on receipt of the SETTINGS. As the recipient consumes the first 16KB, it must send a WINDOW_UPDATE of 16KB back to the sender. This interaction continues until the sender's window size becomes positive again, and it can resume transmitting data frames.
</p>
<p>After the recipient reads in a data frame with FLAG_FIN that marks the end of the data stream, it should not send WINDOW_UPDATE frames as it consumes the last data frame. A sender may ignore all stream window updates for streams where the FLAG_FIN has been received. 
</p>
<p>The data frames from the sender and the WINDOW_UPDATE frames from the recipient are completely asynchronous with respect to each other. This property allows a recipient to aggressively update the window size kept by the sender to prevent the stream from stalling.

CREDENTIAL</h3>

<p>The CREDENTIAL control frame is used by the client to send additional certificates to the client from the server. This is intended to allow for SPDY connection reuse.
</p>
<p>The server is required to maintain a vector of client certificates associated with a SPDY session.  When the client needs to send a client certificate to the server, it will send a CREDENTIAL frame that specifies the index of the slot in which to store the certificate as well as proof that the client posesses the corresponding private key.  The initial size of this vector must be 8.  If the client provides a client certificate during the first TLS handshake, the contents of this certificate must be copied into the first slot (index 1) in the CREDENTIAL vector, though it may be overwritten by subsequent CREDENTIAL frames.  The server must exclusively use the CREDENTIAL vector when evaluating the client certificates associated with an origin.  The server may change the size of this vector by sending a SETTINGS frame with the setting SETTINGS_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_VECTOR_SIZE value specified.  In the event that the new size is smaller than the current size, truncation occurs preserving lower-index slots as possible.
</p>
<p>TLS renegotiation with client authentication is incompatible with SPDY given the multiplexed nature of SPDY.  Specifically, imagine that the client has 2 requests outstanding to the server for two different pages (in different tabs).  When the renegotiation + client certificate request comes in, the browser is unable to determine which resource triggered the client certificate request, in order to prompt the user accordingly.

<p>Slot: The index in the server's client certificate vector where this certificate should be stored.  If there is already a certificate stored at this index, it will be overwritten.  The index is one based, not zero based; zero is an invalid slot index.
</p>
<p>Proof: Cryptographic proof that the client has possession of the private key associated with the certificate.  The format is a TLS digitally-signed element (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-4.7).  The signature algorithm must be the same as that used in the CertificateVerify message.  However, since the MD5+SHA1 signature type used in TLS 1.0 connections can not be correctly encoded in a digitally-signed element, SHA1 must be used when MD5+SHA1 was used in the SSL connection.  The signature is calculated over a 32 byte TLS extractor value (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5705) with a label of "EXPORTER SPDY certificate proof" using the empty string as context. ForRSA certificates the signature would be a PKCS#1 v1.5 signature. For ECDSA, it would be an ECDSA-Sig-Value (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5480#appendix-A).  For a 1024-bit RSA key, the CREDENTIAL message would be ~500 bytes.
</p>
<p>Certificate: The certificate chain, starting with the leaf certificate.  Each certificate must be encoded as a 32 bit length, followed by a DER encoded certificate.  The certificate must be of the same type (RSA, ECDSA, etc) as the client certificate associated with the SSL connection.
</p>
<p>If the server receives a request for a resource with unacceptable credential (either missing or invalid), it must reply with a RST_STREAM frame with the status code INVALID_CREDENTIALS. Upon receipt of a RST_STREAM frame with INVALID_CREDENTIALS, the client should initiate a new stream directly to the requested origin and resend the request.  Note, SPDY does not allow the server to request different client authentication for different resources in the same origin.
</p>
<p>If the server receives an invalid CREDENTIAL frame, it MUST respond with a GOAWAY frame and shutdown the session.

Name/Value Header Block</h3>

<p>The Name/Value Header Block is found in the SYN_STREAM, SYN_REPLY
            and HEADERS control frames, and shares a common format:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

+--------+--------+=====+
| Num Ops(16)     | Ops |    &lt;- This is all gzip compressed.
+--------+--------+=====+

The entire Headers Block is compressed with gzip. The sender may choose to use whatever level of compression works best, which may be uncompressed.
An implementation should be able to easily write an uncompressed block which is inflatable with the gzip library with minimal effort and complexity if this is necessary, though the user's experience may possibly be impacted.
Please see RFC 1952 for a description of the gzip container, and RFC 1951 for a description of its DEFLATE payload. For any connection, there is one gzip context for decompressing, and one gzip context for compressing.



All Name/Value Ops share a common flag byte defined like so:

+--|-|-|----+
|OO|K|L|XXXX|
+--|-|-|----+

OO -&gt; Opcode field. One of 0x0, 0x1, or 0x2.
 K -&gt;  IsKey field. One of 0x0 or 0x1. Indicates whether or not we're addressing a key or value.
 L -&gt;  Level field. One of 0x0 or 0x1. Indicates for certain operations which level of headers table is being modified.
 X -&gt;  Reserved

The Opcode field indicates the type of operation.

  0x0 indicates that the data will not be stored, and two string literals will follow
      The Level and Key fields are ignored in this case.
  0x1 indicates the data which follows should be stored into the specified table entry.
      The table entry is found by examining the Level field, and selecting the table appropriate, then examining the IsKey field, and selecting either the key or value entry.
  0x2 indicates that the specified table entry should me modified by truncating the tail of the current entry to the length specified and then appending the provided string.
      Arguably this operation renders 0x1 redundant, but it would take up more bytes and so we leave in 0x1 for now.


The Level field encodes the headers overlay-level being selected by the current frame.
Valid Level fields are 0x0, and 0x1.

  0x0 is for the current stream group
  0x1 is for the connection

The IsKey field indicates whether the following string value represents a key or value
  0x0 indicates the stored string is for a value
  0x1 indicates the stored string is for a key



Detail of an operation with an opcode of 0x0:

     0        1        2        3       4..k

+--------+--------+--------+========+
| Value String Len(24)     | String |
+--------+--------+--------+========+


Detail of an operation with an opcode of 0x1:

An operation with an Opcode field of 0x1 indicates that the field encodes a replacement to a key or value field of a line in the headers table designated by the L field.

If the 'K' (IsKey) field is 0x0, the subsequent string length and string represents a value.
If the 'K' (IsKey) field is 0x1, the subsequent string length and string represent a key.
If the 'L' (Level) field is 0x0, the header table for the stream group is modified.
If the 'L' (Level) field ix 0x1, the header table for the connection is modified.

      0         1        2        3        4        5
+--|-|-|----+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

+--|-|-|----+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

   6..n
+========+
| String |
+========+

If the token-index refers to an index that is already in use, the string transmitted here replaces it.


Keys must always be stored before the associated value is stored. If a value is stored before the key, the recipient MUST issue a session error (Section 2.4.1) with the status code PROTOCOL_ERROR.

If 'K' field is 0x0 and the specified header table does not yet have a key associated with that token-index, the recipient MUST issue a session error (Section 2.4.1) with the status code PROTOCOL_ERROR.

If String Length field is zero, this indicates that the line at the referenced token-index should be removed from the specified table.


The same entry in any table should be modified at most once in any HEADERS block. If an entry is modified more than once in a HEADERS block, the recipient MUST issue a session error (Section 2.4.1) with the status code PROTOCOL_ERROR.


An operation with an Op field of 0x2 indicates that the field encodes a truncate-and-append to the pre-existing table value. If no value exists, it should instead be inserted into the table at the specified position.
If a value is being set, and no key has been set, the recipient MUST issue a session error (Section 2.4.2) with the status code PROTOCOL_ERROR.

      0         1        2        3        4        5        6        7

<p>The entire contents of the name/value header block is compressed using zlib.  There is a single zlib stream for all name value pairs in one direction on a connection.   SPDY uses a SYNC_FLUSH between each compressed frame.
</p>
<p>Implementation notes: the compression engine can be tuned to favor speed or size. Optimizing for size increases memory use and CPU consumption.  Because header blocks are generally small, implementors may want to reduce the window-size of the compression engine from the default 15bits (a 32KB window) to more like 11bits (a 2KB window).  The exact setting is chosen by the compressor, the decompressor will work with any setting.

HTTP Layering over SPDY</h3>

<p>SPDY is intended to be as compatible as possible with current web-based applications. This means that, from the perspective of the server business logic or application API, the features of HTTP are unchanged. To achieve this, all of the application request and response header semantics are preserved, although the syntax of conveying those semantics has changed.  Thus, the rules from the <a class='info' href='#RFC2616'>HTTP/1.1 specification in RFC2616<span> (</span><span class='info'>Fielding, R., Gettys, J., Mogul, J., Frystyk, H., Masinter, L., Leach, P., and T.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.1"></a><h3>3.1.1.&nbsp;
Use of GOAWAY</h3>

<p>SPDY provides a GOAWAY message which can be used when closing a connection from either the client or server.  Without a server GOAWAY message, HTTP has a race condition where the client sends a request (a new SYN_STREAM)  just as the server is closing the connection, and the client cannot know if the server received the stream or not.  By using the last-stream-id in the GOAWAY, servers can indicate to the client if a request was processed or not.
</p>
<p>Note that some servers will choose to send the GOAWAY and immediately terminate the connection without waiting for active streams to finish.  The client will be able to determine this because SPDY streams are determinstically closed.  This abrupt termination will force the client to heuristically decide whether to retry the pending requests.  Clients always need to be capable of dealing with this case because they must deal with accidental connection termination cases, which are the same as the server never having sent a GOAWAY.
</p>
<p>More sophisticated servers will use GOAWAY to implement a graceful teardown. They will send the GOAWAY and provide some time for the active streams to finish before terminating the connection.
</p>
<p>If a SPDY client closes the connection, it should also send a GOAWAY message.  This allows the server to know if any server-push streams were received by the client.
</p>
<p>If the endpoint closing the connection has not received any SYN_STREAMs from the remote, the GOAWAY will contain a last-stream-id of 0.

Request</h3>

<p>The client initiates a request by sending a SYN_STREAM frame.  For requests which do not contain a body, the SYN_STREAM frame MUST set the FLAG_FIN, indicating that the client intends to send no further data on this stream.  For requests which do contain a body, the SYN_STREAM will not contain the FLAG_FIN, and the body will follow the SYN_STREAM in a series of DATA frames. The last DATA frame will set the FLAG_FIN to indicate the end of the body.
</p>
<p>The SYN_STREAM Name/Value section will contain all of the HTTP headers which are associated with an HTTP request. The header block in SPDY is mostly unchanged from today's HTTP header block, with the following differences:
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>The first line of the request is unfolded into name/value pairs like other HTTP headers and MUST be present:
</p>
<blockquote class="text">

</blockquote>

<p>Header names are all lowercase.
</p>
<p>The Connection, Host, Keep-Alive, Proxy-Connection, and Transfer-Encoding headers are not valid and MUST not be sent.
</p>
<p>User-agents MUST support gzip compression. Regardless of the Accept-Encoding sent by the user-agent, the server may always send content encoded with gzip or deflate encoding.
</p>
<p>If a server receives a request where the sum of the data frame payload lengths does not equal the size of the Content-Length header, the server MUST return a 400 (Bad Request) error.
</p>
<p>POST-specific changes:
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Although POSTs are inherently chunked, POST requests SHOULD also be accompanied by a Content-Length header.

Existing user-agents do not omit the Content-Length header, and server implementations have come to depend upon this.

<p>The user-agent is free to prioritize requests as it sees fit. If the user-agent cannot make progress without receiving a resource, it should attempt to raise the priority of that resource. Resources such as images, SHOULD generally use the lowest priority.

Stateful Authentication</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, the stateful authentication mechanisms were implemented and defined in a such a way that directly violates RFC2617 - they do not include a "realm" as part of the request.  This is problematic in SPDY because it makes it impossible for a client to disambiguate two concurrent server authentication challenges.
</p>
<p>To deal with this case, SPDY servers using Stateful Authentication MUST implement one of two changes:
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Servers can add a "realm=&lt;desired realm&gt;" header so that the two authentication requests can be disambiguated and run concurrently.  Unfortunately, given how these mechanisms work, this is probably not practical.
</p>
<p>Upon sending the first stateful challenge response, the server MUST buffer and defer all further frames which are not part of completing the challenge until the challenge has completed.  Completing the authentication challenge may take multiple round trips.  Once the client receives a "401 Authenticate" response for a stateful authentication type, it MUST stop sending new requests to the server until the authentication has completed by receiving a non-401 response on at least one stream.

<a name="rfc.section.3.3"></a><h3>3.3.&nbsp;
Server Push Transactions</h3>

<p>SPDY enables a server to send multiple replies to a client for a single request.  The rationale for this feature is that sometimes a server knows that it will need to send multiple resources in response to a single request.  Without server push features, the client must first download the primary resource, then discover the secondary resource(s), and request them.  Pushing of resources avoids the round-trip delay, but also creates a potential race where a server can be pushing content which a user-agent is in the process of requesting.  The following mechanics attempt to prevent the race condition while enabling the performance benefit.
</p>
<p>Browsers receiving a pushed response MUST validate that the server is authorized to push the URL using the <a class='info' href='#RFC6454'>browser same-origin<span> (</span><span class='info'>Barth, A., &ldquo;The Web Origin Concept,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2011.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC6454] policy.  For example, a SPDY connection to www.foo.com is generally not permitted to push a response for www.evil.com.
</p>
<p>If the browser accepts a pushed response (e.g. it does not send a RST_STREAM), the browser MUST attempt to cache the pushed response in same way that it would cache any other response.  This means validating the response headers and inserting into the cache.
</p>
<p>Because pushed responses have no request, they have no request headers associated with them.  At the framing layer, SPDY pushed streams contain an "associated-stream-id" which indicates the requested stream for which the pushed stream is related.  The pushed stream inherits all of the headers from the associated-stream-id with the exception of ":host", ":scheme", and ":path", which are provided as part of the pushed response stream headers.  The browser MUST store these inherited and implied request headers with the cached resource.
</p>
<p>Implementation note:  With server push, it is theoretically possible for servers to push unreasonable amounts of content or resources to the user-agent.  Browsers MUST implement throttles to protect against unreasonable push attacks.

<a name="rfc.section.3.3.1"></a><h3>3.3.1.&nbsp;
Server implementation</h3>

<p>When the server intends to push a resource to the user-agent, it opens a new stream by sending a unidirectional SYN_STREAM.  The SYN_STREAM MUST include an Associated-To-Stream-ID, and MUST include headers for ":scheme", ":host", ":path", which represent the URL for the resource being pushed. Subsequent headers may follow in HEADERS frames. The purpose of the association is so that the user-agent can differentiate which request induced the pushed stream; without it, if the user-agent had two tabs open to the same page, each pushing unique content under a fixed URL, the user-agent would not be able to differentiate the requests.
</p>
<p>The Associated-To-Stream-ID must be the ID of an existing, open stream.  The reason for this restriction is to have a clear endpoint for pushed content.  If the user-agent requested a resource on stream 11, the server replies on stream 11.  It can push any number of additional streams to the client before sending a FLAG_FIN on stream 11.  However, once the originating stream is closed no further push streams may be associated with it.  The pushed streams do not need to be closed (FIN set) before the originating stream is closed, they only need to be created before the originating stream closes.
</p>
<p>To prevent a race condition with the client, the server must only use the client certificate of the associated stream when pushing resources.
</p>
<p>It is illegal for a server to push a resource with the Associated-To-Stream-ID of 0, or with a Slot that is not 0.
</p>
<p>To minimize race conditions with the client, the SYN_STREAM for the pushed resources MUST be sent prior to sending any content which could allow the client to discover the pushed resource and request it.
</p>
<p>The server MUST only push resources which would have been returned from a GET request.
</p>
<p>Note:  If the server does not have all of the Name/Value Response headers available at the time it issues the HEADERS frame for the pushed resource, it may later use an additional HEADERS frame to augment the name/value pairs to be associated with the pushed stream.  The subsequent HEADERS frame(s) must not contain a header for ':host', ':scheme', or ':path' (e.g. the server can't change the identity of the resource to be pushed).  The HEADERS frame must not contain duplicate headers with a previously sent HEADERS frame.  The server must send a HEADERS frame including the scheme/host/port headers before sending any data frames on the stream.

Client implementation</h3>

<p>When fetching a resource the client has 3 possibilities:
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>the resource is not being pushed
</p>
<p>the resource is being pushed, but the data has not yet arrived
</p>
<p>the resource is being pushed, and the data has started to arrive
</p>
</blockquote><p>

</p>
<p>When a SYN_STREAM and HEADERS frame which contains an Associated-To-Stream-ID is received, the client must not issue GET requests for the resource in the pushed stream, and instead wait for the pushed stream to arrive.  
</p>
<p>If a client receives a server push stream with stream-id 0, it
 MUST issue a <a class='info' href='#SessionErrorHandler'>session error<span> (</span><span class='info'>Session Error Handling</span><span>)</span></a> with the status code PROTOCOL_ERROR.
</p>
<p>When a client receives a SYN_STREAM from the server without a the ':host', ':scheme', and ':path' headers in the Name/Value section, it MUST reply with a RST_STREAM with error code HTTP_PROTOCOL_ERROR.
</p>
<p>To cancel individual server push streams, the client can issue a <a class='info' href='#StreamErrorHandler'>stream error<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stream Error Handling</span><span>)</span></a> with error code CANCEL.  Upon receipt, the server MUST stop sending on this stream immediately (this is an Abrupt termination).
</p>
<p>To cancel all server push streams related to a request, the client may issue a <a class='info' href='#StreamErrorHandler'>stream error<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stream Error Handling</span><span>)</span></a> with error code CANCEL on the associated-stream-id.  By cancelling that stream, the server MUST immediately stop sending frames for any streams with in-association-to for the original stream.
</p>
<p>If the server sends a HEADER frame containing duplicate headers with a previous HEADERS frame for the same stream, the client must issue a <a class='info' href='#StreamErrorHandler'>stream error<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stream Error Handling</span><span>)</span></a> with error code PROTOCOL ERROR.
</p>
<p>If the server sends a HEADERS frame after sending a data frame for the same stream, the client MAY ignore the HEADERS frame.  Ignoring the HEADERS frame after a data frame prevents handling of HTTP's trailing headers (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.40).

Separation of Framing Layer and Application Layer</h3>

<p>Readers may note that this specification sometimes blends the <a class='info' href='#FramingLayer'>framing layer<span> (</span><span class='info'>SPDY Framing Layer</span><span>)</span></a> with requirements of a specific application - <a class='info' href='#HTTPLayer'>HTTP<span> (</span><span class='info'>HTTP Layering over SPDY</span><span>)</span></a>.  This is reflected in the request/response nature of the streams, the definition of the HEADERS and compression contexts which are very similar to HTTP, and other areas as well.
</p>
<p>This blending is intentional - the primary goal of this protocol is to create a low-latency protocol for use with HTTP.  Isolating the two layers is convenient for description of the protocol and how it relates to existing HTTP implementations.  However, the ability to reuse the SPDY framing layer is a non goal.

Error handling - Framing Layer</h3>

<p>Error handling at the SPDY layer splits errors into two groups:  Those that affect an individual SPDY stream, and those that do not.
</p>
<p>When an error is confined to a single stream, but general framing is in tact, SPDY attempts to use the RST_STREAM as a mechanism to invalidate the stream but move forward without aborting the connection altogether.
</p>
<p>For errors occuring outside of a single stream context, SPDY assumes the entire session is hosed.  In this case, the endpoint detecting the error should initiate a connection close.

<a name="rfc.section.4.3"></a><h3>4.3.&nbsp;
One Connection Per Domain</h3>

<p>SPDY attempts to use fewer connections than other protocols have traditionally used.  The rationale for this behavior is because it is very difficult to provide a consistent level of service (e.g. TCP slow-start), prioritization, or optimal compression when the client is connecting to the server through multiple channels.
</p>
<p>Through lab measurements, we have seen consistent latency benefits by using fewer connections from the client.  The overall number of packets sent by SPDY can be as much as 40% less than HTTP.  Handling large numbers of concurrent connections on the server also does become a scalability problem, and SPDY reduces this load.
</p>
<p>The use of multiple connections is not without benefit, however.  Because SPDY multiplexes multiple, independent streams onto a single stream, it creates a potential for head-of-line blocking problems at the transport level.  In tests so far, the negative effects of head-of-line blocking (especially in the presence of packet loss) is outweighed by the benefits of compression and prioritization.

Fixed vs Variable Length Fields</h3>

<p>SPDY favors use of fixed length 32bit fields in cases where smaller, variable length encodings could have been used.  To some, this seems like a tragic waste of bandwidth.  SPDY choses the simple encoding for speed and simplicity.
</p>
<p>The goal of SPDY is to reduce latency on the network.  The overhead of SPDY frames is generally quite low.  Each data frame is only an 8 byte overhead for a 1452 byte payload (~0.6%).  At the time of this writing, bandwidth is already plentiful, and there is a strong trend indicating that bandwidth will continue to increase.  With an average worldwide bandwidth of 1Mbps, and assuming that a variable length encoding could reduce the overhead by 50%, the latency saved by using a variable length encoding would be less than 100 nanoseconds.  More interesting are the effects when the larger encodings force a packet boundary, in which case a round-trip could be induced.  However, by addressing other aspects of SPDY and TCP interactions, we believe this is completely mitigated.

<a name="rfc.section.4.5"></a><h3>4.5.&nbsp;
Compression Context(s)</h3>

<p>When isolating the compression contexts used for communicating with multiple origins, we had a few choices to make.  We could have maintained a map (or list) of compression contexts usable for each origin.  The basic case is easy - each HEADERS frame would need to identify the context to use for that frame.  However, compression contexts are not cheap, so the lifecycle of each context would need to be bounded.  For proxy servers, where we could churn through many contexts, this would be a concern.  We considered using a static set of contexts, say 16 of them, which would bound the memory use.  We also considered dynamic contexts, which could be created on the fly, and would need to be subsequently destroyed.  All of these are complicated, and ultimately we decided that such a mechanism creates too many problems to solve.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, we've chosen the simple approach, which is to simply provide a flag for resetting the compression context.  For the common case (no proxy), this fine because most requests are to the same origin and we never need to reset the context.  For cases where we are using two different origins over a single SPDY session, we simply reset the compression state between each transition.

Unidirectional streams</h3>

Data Compression</h3>

<p>Generic compression of data portion of the streams (as opposed to compression of the headers) without knowing the content of the stream is redundant.  There is no value in compressing a stream which is already compressed.  Because of this, SPDY initially allowed data compression to be optional.  We included it because study of existing websites shows that many sites are not using compression as they should, and users suffer because of it.  We wanted a mechanism where, at the SPDY layer, site administrators could simply force compression - it is better to compress twice than to not compress.
</p>
<p>Overall, however, with this feature being optional and sometimes redundant, it was unclear if it was useful at all.  We removed it from the specification.

Server Push</h3>

<p>A subtle but important point is that server push streams must be declared before the associated stream is closed.  The reason for this is so that proxies have a lifetime for which they can discard information about previous streams.  If a pushed stream could associate itself with an already-closed stream, then endpoints would not have a specific lifecycle for when they could disavow knowledge of the streams which went before.

HTTP Headers and SPDY Headers</h3>

<p>At the application level, HTTP uses name/value pairs in its headers.  Because SPDY merges the existing HTTP headers with SPDY headers, there is a possibility that some HTTP applications already use a particular header name.  To avoid any conflicts, all headers introduced for layering HTTP over SPDY are prefixed with ":".  ":" is not a valid sequence in HTTP header naming, preventing any possible conflict.

Cross-Protocol Attacks</h3>

<p>By utilizing TLS, we believe that SPDY introduces no new cross-protocol attacks.  TLS encrypts the contents of all transmission (except the handshake itself), making it difficult for attackers to control the data which could be used in a cross-protocol attack.

Server Push Implicit Headers</h3>

<p>Pushed resources do not have an associated request.  In order for existing HTTP cache control validations (such as the Vary header) to work, however, all cached resources must have a set of request headers.  For this reason, browsers MUST be careful to inherit request headers from the associated stream for the push.  This includes the 'Cookie' header.

Long Lived Connections</h3>

<p>SPDY aims to keep connections open longer between clients and servers in order to reduce the latency when a user makes a request.  The maintenance of these connections over time could be used to expose private information.  For example, a user using a browser hours after the previous user stopped using that browser may be able to learn about what the previous user was doing.  This is a problem with HTTP in its current form as well, however the short lived connections make it less of a risk.

SETTINGS frame</h3>

<p>The SPDY SETTINGS frame allows servers to store out-of-band transmitted information about the communication between client and server on the client.  Although this is intended only to be used to reduce latency, renegade servers could use it as a mechanism to store identifying information about the client in future requests.
</p>
<p>Clients implementing privacy modes, such as Google Chrome's "incognito mode", may wish to disable client-persisted SETTINGS storage.
</p>
<p>Clients MUST clear persisted SETTINGS information when clearing the cookies.

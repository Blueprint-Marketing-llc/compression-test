How To Edit The SPDY Spec
-------------------------

The master copy is stored in draft-mbelshe-spdy-00.xml.  This is a XML file
which uses the syntax defined in RFC2629:  http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2629.txt.
The file rfc2629.xml is a XSLT file which enables the browser to take the
draft-mbelshe-spdy-00.xml and render it.

FILES
-----
README                       This file
draft-mbelshe-spdy-00.xml    The SPDY specification XML file
generate.sh                  A script to generate RFC-formats of the SPDY spec

rfcmarkup                    A script to generate HTML from a RFC .txt file

Directions to edit:
-------------------
1) learn the basic XML syntax
2) edit draft-mbelshe-spdy-00.xml with your favorite editor
3) Open draft-mbelshe-spdy-00.xml in your favortie browser to view.
   I recommend viewing in firefox, as it reports better xml syntax errors than
   chrome does.

Directions to Publish:
----------------------
1) sudo apt-get install xml2rfc
2) sh ./generate.sh
   This will build both a txt and html RFC-style draft.
